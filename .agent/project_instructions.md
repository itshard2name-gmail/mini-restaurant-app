Every time you start a new conversation in this workspace, you MUST first read the following files to anchor yourself in the project's context, architecture, and design rules:

1.  `README.md`: System overview, core features, and quick start guide.
2.  `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`: Detailed architecture, API specs, and technical decisions.

These files are the **Source of Truth** for this project. All code changes and feature implementations must adhere to the patterns and guidelines defined therein.
